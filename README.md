<h1>experiment1</h1>

<h2>why did i choose to code</h2>
<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet"
href="css/my-first-stylesheet.css"/>
<p>the reason i chose to code is because i went with my mom to a libary that was infront of my home and then my mom said that we should go there so we got here and i pick out books that have interested me then i picked out a book about coding then i read it and i started to programme on my laptop. as well as this my aunt is also a programmer but she does not come to our home all the time so i get books and i start to programme by  my self and i made a website before her. i hope to become a better programmer in the future and to start doing machine engineering.</p>
